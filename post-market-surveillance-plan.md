# Post-Market Surveillance Plan

This plan describes product-specific post-market surveillance activities. 

## Product

| Product Name | Version   | Surveillance Period |

## 1. General Considerations

The document describes the activities that are to be undertaken for post-deployment surveillance and the frequency at 
which they are conducted. The data gathered in this post market surveillance report will be used to: 

- to update the benefit-risk determination and to improve the risk management;
- to update the design and manufacturing information, the instructions for use and the labelling;
- to update the clinical evaluation;
- to update the summary of safety and clinical performance;
- for the identification of needs for preventive, corrective or field safety corrective action;
- for the identification of options to improve the usability, performance and safety of the device;
- when relevant, to contribute to the post-market surveillance of other devices; and
- to detect and report trends.


According to Annex III section 1.1 (b) MDR, the post-market surveillance plan shall cover:

## 3. Data Collection Categories

At minimum, the information required by the process for post-market **surveillance** is collected. For MR Spectroscopy, 
the following categories of data will be collected  specifically:

### Information about other devices*

 * [BfArM Field Corrective Actions][bfarm-fca]
   * Keywords: "MR Spectroscopy"
   * Filter:
   * Time span: Last 12 months
 * [BfArM Recommendations][bfarm-rec]
   * Keywords:"MR Spectroscopy"
   * Time span:
 * [MHRA][mhra]
   * Keywords:"MR Spectroscopy"
   * Filter: 
   * Time span: Last 12 months
 * [Swissmedic: List of recalls and other field corrective actions][swissmedic]
   * Keywords:"MR Spectroscopy"
   * Time span: Last 12 months
 * [FDA Recalls: medical device recalls][fda-recalls]
   * Keywords:"MR Spectroscopy"
   * Time span: Last 12 months
 * [FDA Maude][fda-maude]
   * Keywords:"MR Spectroscopy"
   * Time span: Last 12 months
 * SOUP Incident Reports
   * Go through SOUP list
   * Research public incident reports of the last (enter time span) months

### Other information about similar devices

 * Google News Search
   * Filter: MR Spectroscopy
   * Time span:Last 12 months
 * JISCMAIL (UK Medical Physics Mailing List)
   * Filter: "MR spectroscopy"
   * Time span: Last 12 months

### Specialist literature / technical databases

> Note: This chapter should analyze other publications applicable to our product which are not considered
> already (or typically) as part of the post-market clinical follow-up.

 * Pubmed
   * Filter: MR Spectroscopy 
   * Time span: last 12 months


### Serious incidents of our medical device

 * Incident documentation
   * None
### Non-serious incidents and undesirable side-effects of our own medical device

 * Feedback and customer complaints
   * None

### Feedback we collect from our partners, users, distributors, importers

 * Feedback and customer complaints
   * Filter: not hazard-related feedback, feedback to performance, safety or processes
   * Time span:

### Trends

 * Compile list of trends as described in the section below.

## 4. Trend Analysis

Trend analysis is performed with a focus on undesirable side-effects and non-serious incidents. These will be
monitored if they impact the benefit-risk ratio in a negative way.

Hazards in the risk table are compared to post-market surveillance results:

 * If post-deployment surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **probability** was too low (= event
   happened more often in post-market surveillance), actions are initiated as described in the CSC PR.005 "Monitoring and Surveillance".
 * If post-deployment surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **severity** was too low (= event
   happened led to more serious harm in post-deployment surveillance), a CAPA is initiated.
